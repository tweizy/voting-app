A Vue.js web app for creating and interacting with community events.

## Deployed App

Visit the deployed site here: [EventVote on Netlify](https://visionary-cocada-55a3b8.netlify.app)

## Technologies

- Vue 3
- Firebase (Authentication & Firestore)
- Tailwind CSS
- Heroicons

## How It Works

1. Users can register or sign in (email or Google) to access the dashboard.  
2. Once signed in, they can create new events, vote on existing events, and manage their own.  
3. Firebase stores events, users, and votes securely, while Tailwind CSS styles the entire application.

## Project Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```
